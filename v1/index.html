Ok. I want to make a text based game in the browser.
You could do that by linking regular static pages together, but where's the fun in that.
We want to emulate that semi-terminal experience with monospaced fonts, command parsers and stuff.

So first off I need a place to output text and somewhere to input it.

<div class="terminal-window"></div>
<input class="command-input" type="text"/>

Booyaah! We're hackers!

/*
So I want to build some sort of text based world; made of rooms with descriptions which I can walk around in.
So I think:
*/

function Room(opts) {
	this.description = opts.desc;

/*
Supers! Now I can create funky rooms.
*/

var livingroom = new Room({
	desc: "Really nice livingroom. There's a tv and all!"
});

var bathroom = new Room({
	desc: "You're in a bathroom. Some people come here to poo."

/*
Then we need to be able to link these together too. 
Something like roomA.addExit('exitName', roomB);
*/

	this.description = opts.desc;

var bathroom = new Room({

bathroom.addExit("out", livingroom);

/*
Having the bathroom next to the livingroom isn't completely wise but this is a game, we can do anything!

To track in which room we are; let's say there's a var called currentRoom.
*/

/*
Ok. Think we have enough data to make this playable somehow.

We want a 'look' command which displays the room description and its exits.
In addition we want each exit name in the room to be a command which takes us into that room.

We want to take the user's commands from the '.command-input' element, parse them and react to that.

I guess we can represent a command as a function.
On enter keypress we should execute some sort of command parser which returns the command function.

To output stuff into our "terminal window" we'll create a "print" function.
