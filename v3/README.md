Text game v3

What happened since last episode:
- Wanted to add some more advanced commands; so introduced jasmine specs so I can get quicker feedback.
- Mainly the custom room specific actions; otherwise just tweaks to existing stuff
- Got too lazy to handle deps manually so started using bower

Since this now requires some setup here are the instructions:
- install node & npm
- install bower
- cd v3
- bower install
