Text game v4

Changelog:
  - I wanted to create some structure for the source code; folders and what not.
  - I mostly ended up splitting out stuff from CommandParser
  - In the end I split out so much that I decided to change it from a class
    to a simple parse function


Since this now requires some setup here are the instructions:
- install node & npm
- install bower
- cd v4
- bower install

Run tests by opening spec/SpecRunner.html in a browser
